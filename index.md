# micro:bit Resources for Year 8 Code Cadets

Congratulations on receiving your shiny new BBC micro:bit. This website is designed to get you started along your journey towards making some amazing projects on your micro:bit.

For the moment we are encouraging you to hack on your micro:bit in your spare time (and during our SC304 open-hours at lunchtimes, if you are available) as we are keen to see what you build. Later this term we will potentially look at ways that we can integrate the micro:bit into your afternoon Code Cadets sessions.

## What is the micro:bit?

The micro:bit is an _embedded system_ - this means a computer system designed to fulfill a particular purpose. In the case of the micro:bit, this can be whatever purpose you want as you can program the micro:bit yourself. Think about it this way, anything you can program on your computer you can also program on the micro:bit...just with a few differences, such as the lack of a monitor (you instead have a LED matrix display). That said, there are also many cool features on the micro:bit which you can use that you couldn't easily use on a computer - including a radio (allowing you to communicate with other micro:bits) and an accelerometer (to measure motion, vibration, etc.).

There's also other more advanced things you can do, such as connecting external components (including headphones, motors, etc.) - talk to Mr Purcell once you are familiar with the micro:bit if you want to get hooked up with some additional componentry to make a cool project.

## How can I get started?

Your first port of call should be Grok Learning which has a micro:bit Crash Course - which will take you through all the basics of programming for the platform. All CGS students have access to Grok Learning and you can login using your normal CGS Connect credentials by going here: [https://groklearning.com/sso/saml2/login?idp=au-act-cgs](https://groklearning.com/sso/saml2/login?idp=au-act-cgs){:target="_blank"}

It's important that you work through the Crash Course as this will introduce you to the key features of the micro:bit. However, feel free to divert off the tutorials and make your own projects at any time!

Once you're in Grok Learning, head to the [BBC micro:bit Crash Course](https://groklearning.com/course/microbit-crash-course/){:target="_blank"}. There is a micro:bit simulator built into Grok Learning, but since you have the hardware you can also download your code onto the micro:bit and run it on the actual hardware. The Crash Course will take you through how to download the code onto your micro:bit.

## What next?

We're going to continue adding to this page with project ideas, but we are particularly keen to see what ideas you come-up with too!
